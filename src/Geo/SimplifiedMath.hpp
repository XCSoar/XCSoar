 * @brief Library for calculating Earth dimensions
 *
 * This library provides general functions for calculating dimensions
 * on the Earth with GPS coordinates.  The implementations are
 * "simplified", i.e. they are fast but not as accurate as they could
 * be.  Instead of using the WGS84 model, they assume the FAI sphere.
