  This feature of having a backup artificial horizon based on inferred
  orientation from GPS and vario data is useful, and reasonably well
  tested, but has the issue of potentially invalidating use of XCSoar in
  FAI contests due to rule ref Annex A to Section 3 (2010 Edition) 4.1.2
  "No instruments permitting pilots to fly without visual reference to
  the ground may be carried on board, even if made unserviceable."  The
  quality of XCSoar's pseudo-AH is arguably good enough that this
  violates the rule.  We need to seek clarification as to whether this
  is the case or not.
