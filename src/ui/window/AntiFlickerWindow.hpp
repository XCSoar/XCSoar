 * platforms such as Windows draw directly to the screen, which may
 * expose the window before drawing has finished.  On these,
 * #AntiFlickerWindow will be buffered.  On OpenGL/SDL, which both have
 * full-screen double-buffering, this class is a simple #PaintWindow
 * without extra buffering.
 *
 * Note that this class is not supposed to reduce the number of
 * redraws when this is expensive.  Use it only when flicker avoidance
 * is the goal.
