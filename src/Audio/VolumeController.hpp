/**
 * Helper class for controlling master audio volume.
 *
 * It can control two types of audio volume levels:
 * * Internal (software-side) volume level (via #PCMMixer).
 * * External volume: If HAVE_EXT_VOLUME_CONTROLLER is defined, this component
 *   takes control of the audio device's volume level. Controlling this volume
 *   is usually not desired on a general-purpose OS, where the user can use a
 *   volume controller application, whose setting should be respected and should
 *   not be overridden. But can be useful for embedded systems, where no such
 *   system-wide volume controller exists.
 *
 * Volume levels can be higher than 100% (see GetMaxValue()). The meaning of
 * this is: volume levels up to 100% are considered "safe", which means that
 * normally no cipping artifacts can occur. Using higher volume levels does
 * likely cause clipping artifacts.
 *
 * All public functions are thread-safe.
