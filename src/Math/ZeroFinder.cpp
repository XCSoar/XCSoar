 *	    		    C math library
 * function ZEROIN - obtain a function zero within the given range
 *
 * Input
 *	double zeroin(ax,bx,f,tol)
 *	double ax; 			Root will be seeked for within
 *	double bx;  			a range [ax,bx]
 *	double (*f)(double x);		Name of the function whose zero
 *					will be seeked for
 *	double tol;			Acceptable tolerance for the root
 *					value.
 *					May be specified as 0.0 to cause
 *					the program to find the root as
 *					accurate as possible
 *
 * Output
 *	Zeroin returns an estimate for the root with accuracy
 *	4*epsilon*abs(x) + tol
 *
 * Algorithm
 *	G.Forsythe, M.Malcolm, C.Moler, Computer methods for mathematical
 *	computations. M., Mir, 1980, p.180 of the Russian edition
 *
 *	The function makes use of the bissection procedure combined with
 *	the linear or quadric inverse interpolation.
 *	At every step program operates on three abscissae - a, b, and c.
 *	b - the last and the best approximation to the root
 *	a - the last but one approximation
 *	c - the last but one or even earlier approximation than a that
 *		1) |f(b)| <= |f(c)|
 *		2) f(b) and f(c) have opposite signs, i.e. b and c confine
 *		   the root
 *	At every step Zeroin selects one of the two new approximations, the
 *	former being obtained by the bissection procedure and the latter
 *	resulting in the interpolation (if a,b, and c are all different
 *	the quadric interpolation is utilized, otherwise the linear one).
 *	If the latter (i.e. obtained by the interpolation) point is 
 *	reasonable (i.e. lies within the current interval [b,c] not being
 *	too close to the boundaries) it is accepted. The bissection result
 *	is used in the other case. Therefore, the range of uncertainty is
 *	ensured to be reduced at least by the factor 1.6

 *
 * Output
 *	Fminbr returns an estimate for the minimum location with accuracy

 *	The function always obtains a local minimum which coincides with
 *	the global one only if a function under investigation being

 *	The function makes use of the "gold section" procedure combined with
 *	the parabolic interpolation.
 *	At every step program operates three abscissae - x,v, and w.
 *	x - the last and the best approximation to the minimum location,
 *	    i.e. f(x) <= f(a) or/and f(x) <= f(b)
 *	    (if the function f has a local minimum in (a,b), then the both
 *	    conditions are fulfiled after one or two steps).
 *	v,w are previous approximations to the minimum location. They may
 *	coincide with a, b, or x (although the algorithm tries to make all
 *	u, v, and w distinct). Points x, v, and w are used to construct
 *	interpolating parabola whose minimum will be treated as a new
 *	approximation to the minimum location if the former falls within
 *	[a,b] and reduces the range enveloping minimum more efficient than
 *	the gold section procedure. 
 *	When f(x) has a second derivative positive at the minimum location
 *	(not coinciding with a or b) the procedure converges superlinearly
 *	at a rate order about 1.324
