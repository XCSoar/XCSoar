 * Shifts, rotates and scales the given polygon.
 *
 * @param poly Points specifying the polygon
 * @param n Number of points of the polygon
 * @param shift The polygon is placed with position (0,0) centered here.
 * @param angle Angle of rotation
 * @param scale An input polygon with coordinates in the range -50 to +50
 *        is scaled to fill a square with the size of the 'scale' argument.
 *        (The scale value 100 preserves the size of the input polygon.)
 *        For best scaling precision, avoid 'scale' values smaller than
 *        the intended size of the polygon.
 * @param use_fast_scale If true, additional scaling via FastScale()
 *        will be applied. This flag is only intended for backwards
 *        compatibility as the use of FastScale() is deprecated.
