/**
 * RoutePlanner is an abstract class for planning paths (routes) through
 * an arbitrary environment, avoiding obstacles of different types.
 *
 * Paths take into account the origin and destination altitudes and use
 * an approximate form of the aircraft performance model in path planning,
 * such that the solution path is minimum time.  Effect of wind and glide polar
 * variations (mc value, bugs, ballast etc) are accounted for.
 *
 * Where climbs are necessary to reach the destination, the climbs are assumed
 * to occur at the start of the route.  Solutions are allowed in which the
 * aircraft arrives at the destination higher than specified.
 *
 * Climbs above the higher of the start and destination altitude are penalised
 * by a slower MC than that specified in the glide polar.  This is required to
 * prevent the optimiser from simply climbing over all mountains.
 *
 * Climbs may also be limited by an absolute ceiling if required.  This will
 * allow inversion heights etc to be incorporated.
 *
 * Climb-Cruise mode flight is assumed to be performed with no height loss and
 * course variations (in other words, a straight line).  This simplification is
 * required to reduce computational load, but also makes sense since otherwise
 * the planner would have to expect climbs exactly at particular locations,
 * which is unrealistic.
 *
 * Replanning is not performed when the origin/destination or other properties
 * have not changed.
 *
 * Failures of the solver result in the route reverting to direct flight from
 * origin to destination.
 *
 * This class has built-in support for terrain avoidance.  TerrainRoute
 * implements the pure abstract methods required for a minimal terrain avoidance
 * path planner.
 *
 * See AirspaceRoute for an extension of RoutePlanner which avoids terrain as
 * well as airspace.
 *
 * Since this class calls RasterMap functions repeatedly, rather than acquiring
 * and releasing locks each time, we assume the hookup to the main program
 * (RoutePlannerGlue) is responsible for locking the RasterMap on solve() calls.
