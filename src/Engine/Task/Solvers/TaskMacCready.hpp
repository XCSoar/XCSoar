/**
 * Abstract class for calculation of glide solutions with respect
 * to ordered tasks.  This class handles high intermediate turnpoints
 * whereby the aircraft's glide angle after achieving a turnpoint at minimum
 * height may be higher than final glide beyond that.
 *
 * An assumption is made that final glide is made at the latest part of the
 * task, and climbs are made as early as possible.
 *
 * Therefore, this system performs a scan to calculate effective minimum
 * heights for each task point which may be higher than the actual task point's
 * true minimum height.
 *
 * This system also uses a local copy of the glide polar so it can be used
 * for algorithms that adjust glide polar parameters.
 *
 * The class is not intended to be used directly, but to be specialised.
