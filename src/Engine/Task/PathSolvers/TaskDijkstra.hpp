 * Class used to scan an OrderedTask for maximum/minimum distance
 * points.
 *
 * Uses flat-projected integer representation of search points for
 * speed, but this also makes the system approximate.
 *
 * Search points are located on OZ boundaries and each form a convex
 * hull, as this produces the minimum search vector size without loss
 * of accuracy.
 *
 * Searches are sensitive to active task point, in that task points
 * before the active task point need only be searched for maximum achieved
 * distance rather than border search points. 
 *
 * Before each calculation, set up this object with SetTaskSize() and
 * call SetBoundary() for each task point.
 *
 * This uses a Dijkstra search and so is O(N log(N)).
