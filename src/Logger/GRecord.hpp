   * Background information: in XCSoar 6.5, the IGC standard was
   * implemented correctly for the first time, and the comma became a
   * legal character.  Up to XCSoar 6.4.6, the comma was not only
   * ignored for the GRecord, but also eliminated from IGC files.
   * This made XCSoar 6.5 incompatible with the old vali-xcs program
   * (TRAC #2657).
   *
   * This attribute is the workaround: ignore_comma=false means that
   * we're currently reading a XCSoar 6.5 IGC file.
   *
   * When writing a new IGC file, the comma is written, but ignored
   * for the G record calculation.
