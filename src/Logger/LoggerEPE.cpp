 * EPE - Estimated Position Error - An estimate by a GNSS receiver of the probability of position error in each fix,
 * taking into account the geometry factors of DOP (qv above) with the addition of factors such as received signal
 * strength. The probability used in the calculation should be stated so that the significance of the size of the
 * resulting shape (frequently a circular error) is known. Probabilities are frequently calculated to a 2-sigma
 * (95.45%) level, implying that there is about a 95% (19 out of 20) chance that the true position is inside the shape
 * concerned. This probability figure applies to a single fix in isolation and is increased by taking into account
 * adjacent fixes and with knowledge of how gliders are flown. The EPE value appears in the IGC file as a three
 * number group in metres through the FXA code. (AL3)
 *
 * DOP - Dilution of Precision - The reduction of precision in a GNSS fix due to the geometry of the constellation
 * (of satellites used for the fix. Computed by a GNSS receiver for each fix, see also Estimated Position Error
 * (EPE). DOP can be estimated in various ways, including, HDOP (Horizontal position), GDOP (Geometric),
 * PDOP (Position, overall), TDOP (Time) and VDOP (Vertical position). EPE also varies with constellation
 * position. Some definitions from RTCA sources are given below (RTCA = the US Radio Technical Commission
 * for Aeronautics). (AL5)
 *
 * Horizontal fix accuracy - the best prediction for the horizontal 2-sigma (95.45% probability) error of the overall
 * position error. Included in the IGC data file in the B (fix) record through the FXA three-letter code. (AL4)

   * EPE (Estimated Position Error in meters)
   * based on Parkinson, Bradford W. Global Positioning System Theory and Applications Volume 1.
   * URE (User Range Error) is an estimate of "Signals in Space" errors, i.e., ephemeris data,
   * satellite clocks, ionospheric delay and tropospheric delay. These errors can be greatly
   * reduced by differential and multiple frequency techniques. Differential correction sources
   * include user provided reference stations, community base stations, governmental beacon
   * transmissions, FM sub-carrier transmissions and geosynchronous satellite transmissions.

   * UEE (User Equipment Errors) includes receiver noise, multipath, antenna orientation,
   * EMI/RFI. Receiver and antenna design can greatly reduce UEE error sources--usually at
   * substantial cost.
