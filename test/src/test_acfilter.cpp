  use get_speed() and get_climb_rate() as inputs to AirspacePerformanceModel()
  as a potential constructor for short range.

  look for intersections along this line (possibly with vert speed margins)

  so, four airspace warning queries:
   -- inside
   -- intersection in short duration (next 10 seconds):  warning
   -- intersection in medium duration (based on filter), 1 minute?
   -- long duration based on task track (display only highlighted)
