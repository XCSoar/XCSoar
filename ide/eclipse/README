Those files are meant to use with the eclipse IDE version 3.5 and 3.6.

Just copy them into the main project directory, e.g. on Linux issue

cp .cproject .project ../../.

in this directory. On Windows those "dot" files are visible in the file explorer and
you easily drag them to the main project directory.

The templates are set up for developing XCSoar with eclipse on Windows.
If you like to use them on Linux you most likely want to change the TARGET to something different from PC, but that depends on your intent.

Have fun
