    reads and functions as "next".  "previous" reads and functions as "previous" if
    not armed, "disarm" if armed.
  - time margin of AAT optimisation is configurable under "Default task turnpoints" page, expert mode
    as "Optimisation Margin" option.
  - auto goto task: when no task is defined then on takeoff, if there is a waypoint
    within 1km of the takeoff location, a goto task pointing back to this location

- Added height reference for Start max height rule (allows MSL or AGL)
- Increased accuracy of terrain footprint
- Added LS6-15 polar
- Cruise efficiency displayed and adjustable in task calculator.  The cruise efficiency
  is the increased average speed of the glider in cruise, due to dolphining or flying in
  rising air.  It is calculated and displayed in the task calculator.
  If the value is edited, then it will be used subsequently in arrival time calculations.
- Added g load estimation when acceleromter not connected
- Added experimental distance vario infobox.
  This is the the difference in height required to complete the task divided by the time step.
- Improved task speed instantaneous
- Hour glass used in nearestairspace input event, since this can take a few
  seconds.
- White bold (a la Google maps) on task waypoint labels
- Added input event "GotoLookup" which allows a single menu item to bring up the waypoint select
  dialog, and if a waypoint is selected, it will Goto and clear task.
  See pc.xci for example (it replaces the "Task Save" button)
- Fixed situation where auto Mc can wind down after task start due to manoeuvering near start
- When logger is started, if the task hasn't been saved, it is saved to the default task.

Changes from 5.1.7 beta1:
- Vario gauge shows thick red/blue line for sink/lift
- Last thermal stats only used if thermal gain > 0 and
  thermal time > 45 seconds.  This prevents spurious entries for ignored
  thermals, or for quick pullups in thermals without sustained turns.
- Not just airports but landpoints can now have "airfield" details

Changes from 5.1.6:
- Map scale display for non-metric units
- Fixed initialisation of AAT properties when adding waypoints from
  waypoint dialog

-------------------------------------------------------

- "Speed remaining" in status dialog renamed to "Speed estimated" as
  it gives the estimated final speed of the task
- Increased size of up/down arrows in FLARM gauge
- In target dialog, can move target up/down/left/right on Altair with
    DISP/CFG/F5/F6 keys, on PC with 2/3/6/7 keys
- Added blue line of constant distance arc in AAT sectors
- Fixed bug in LD vario and LD GPS calculations
- Added LX sentance (LXWP0) to support Condor
- Fixed bug in auto mc
- Task speed stats reset on task start/restart.

Changes from 5.1.5 beta 5:
- In target dialog, north up and north track modes cause screen orientation
  to be north-up
- Calculations in the target dialog is based on a timer now rather than triggered
  on change, to prevent calculations slowing down the refresh.

Changes from 5.1.5 beta 4:
- Infoboxes (AA Time, Task Time To Go, Next Time To Go,
             Task Arrival Time, AA Delta Time)
  now use consistent color format:
     black/white: AAT est > min time
     blue: AAT est turning now > min time
     red: AAT est < min time
- Task editor/overview page shows file name of task in caption, and shows '*'
   if task is edited and not saved.
- Bug fixes to tasman instruments vario
- Text entry dialog uses larger font
- Flight logger can use short file name, if "Logger short file" is true.
- Flight logger gets ID from 3-letter logger ID
  in System config, if not set this defaults to 'AAA'.
- AAT zero range (nominal) task is displayed thin green dashed,
  target task is displayed in thick green dashed
- Added new infobox "Thermal All / TC All" for gps vario averaged across
  all time spent in circling mode.
- Speedups and bug fixes to effective/achieved Mc calculations.
  achieved Mc is no longer influenced by gliding off high starts.

  faster, and more robust.

- Draw centroid/'bmw' symbol at targets in AAT task
- Calculate AAT time to go if turning now while in sector, then
   going to remaining targets after this.
- AA dT infobox goes blue if task time > AAT time + 5 minutes when in sector
   and pilot turns now.
  Therefore, particularly in last AAT sector, when AA dT is blue,
  it is reasonably safe to turn now, even if the target is deeper in the
  sector.  (only if color infoboxes are on)
- Set waypoint bearing and best cruise track to first leg bearing
  when in start sector, so blue arrow points to first target, and
  so does screen orientation.

Changes from 5.1.4:
- Target dialog steps in 2% and 2 degrees instead of 5.

  towards task line from previous target through aircraft when advancing

  dialog (e.g. details, move up/down, select, remove) since they're not
