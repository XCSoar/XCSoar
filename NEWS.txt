      formerly known as the glide terrain footprint, now referred to as 'reach'.
    - this can calculate the reach around terrain obstacles
    - landable waypoints visible on the map are marked according to whether they are
      reachable
    - the reach calculation is configurable, turning search can be disabled if
      running on low-powered devices.
* map
  - north arrow is automatically hidden in north-up mode
  - added configurable slope shading (off/fixed/wind/sun)
  - autozoom uses stepless zooming and has configurable upper distance bound
  - "north up" map orientation now respects "glider position offset"
    by configuring a "shifting axis", i.e.
    - shifting based on bearing to target (i.e. North orientated "target up")
    - shifting based on average of recent ground track
      (i.e. North orientated "track up")
  - the estimated thermal position is now used as map center during circling
  - a selection of which waypoint labels are displayed is now possible
    (All, Task & Landables, Task and None).
  - different rendering of roads based on importance (major, normal, minor)
  - a different font is used for rendering important topology labels (i.e. big cities)
  - landables can be displayed with runway heading and proportional length if the
    necessary data is contained in the waypoint files
  - glide terrain range line more detailed, uses 50 radial points rather than 20
  - added option to display track bearing line in map

  - "long-click" in task turnpoint zone displays Target dialog
  - "arm advance" menu buttons removed.  Next/previous buttons function as normal
    for turnpoints (including startpoints) not requiring arming, for those that do
    require arm, "next" reads and functions as "arm" on first press and once armed,
    reads and functions as "next".  "previous" reads and functions as "previous" if
    not armed, "disarm" if armed.
  - time margin of AAT optimisation is configurable under "Default task turnpoints" page, expert mode
    as "Optimisation Margin" option.
  - auto goto task: when no task is defined then on takeoff, if there is a waypoint
    within 1km of the takeoff location, a goto task pointing back to this location
    is automatically created.

  in % for that leg along track line on map.
- Cruise efficiency stays at user-set value; if the field is selected and press ENTER, then the value will be calculated (and set to that value).
- Fixed minor bug in energy height compensation of thermal stats
- Minor improvements to analysis dialog
- Improvements to task speed instantaneous (new, more robust algorithm)

Changes from 5.1.6:
- Map scale display for non-metric units
- Fixed initialisation of AAT properties when adding waypoints from

  it gives the estimated final speed of the task

Changes from 5.1.5 beta 5:

  to be north-up
- Calculations in the target dialog is based on a timer now rather than triggered
  on change, to prevent calculations slowing down the refresh.

Changes from 5.1.5 beta 4:
- Infoboxes (AA Time, Task Time To Go, Next Time To Go,
             Task Arrival Time, AA Delta Time)
  now use consistent color format:
     black/white: AAT est > min time
     blue: AAT est turning now > min time
     red: AAT est < min time
- Task editor/overview page shows file name of task in caption, and shows '*'
   if task is edited and not saved.
- Bug fixes to tasman instruments vario
- Text entry dialog uses larger font
- Flight logger can use short file name, if "Logger short file" is true.
- Flight logger gets ID from 3-letter logger ID
  in System config, if not set this defaults to 'AAA'.
- AAT zero range (nominal) task is displayed thin green dashed,
  target task is displayed in thick green dashed
- Added new infobox "Thermal All / TC All" for gps vario averaged across
  all time spent in circling mode.

  faster, and more robust.

  where legs started
- Locked targets are unlocked as soon as the AAT area is entered

Changes from 5.1.5 beta 1:
- Changed ExternalTriggerCruise to enum, so it can be off,
    "flap", or "SC" (speed command).
  Existing value of true is equivalent to "flap".
- Draw centroid/'bmw' symbol at targets in AAT task
- Calculate AAT time to go if turning now while in sector, then
   going to remaining targets after this.
- AA dT infobox goes blue if task time > AAT time + 5 minutes when in sector
   and pilot turns now.
  Therefore, particularly in last AAT sector, when AA dT is blue,
  it is reasonably safe to turn now, even if the target is deeper in the
  sector.  (only if color infoboxes are on)
- Set waypoint bearing and best cruise track to first leg bearing
  when in start sector, so blue arrow points to first target, and
  so does screen orientation.

Changes from 5.1.4:
- Target dialog steps in 2% and 2 degrees instead of 5.
- AAT target direction and best cruise track arrow (blue) extends
  towards task line from previous target through aircraft when advancing
  the target (aircraft is going past target)

  means user doesn't need to go back into AAT turnpoints after adding them
- Reorganised fields in task editor waypoint properties for more intuitive
  ordering.
- When adding waypoints from task editor, don't show misc buttons in turnpoint
  dialog (e.g. details, move up/down, select, remove) since they're not
  required here.
- Task editor, removed move down/up buttons when at extremities of task
- Added 2 more airspace patterns

- Auto positioning of targets when behind target inside AAT sector is disabled
  when target dialog is open
- TC Avg infobox now shown in red if value < 2/3 of Mc

- Allow negative times in infoboxes and dialogs (in particular for AAT
  time to go)
