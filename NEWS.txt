    reads and functions as "next".  "previous" reads and functions as "previous" if
    not armed, "disarm" if armed.
  - time margin of AAT optimisation is configurable under "Default task turnpoints" page, expert mode
    as "Optimisation Margin" option.
  - auto goto task: when no task is defined then on takeoff, if there is a waypoint

- When off-course by more than 10 degrees, shows distance penalty
  in % for that leg along track line on map.
- Cruise efficiency stays at user-set value; if the field is selected and press ENTER, then the value will be calculated (and set to that value).
- Fixed minor bug in energy height compensation of thermal stats
- Minor improvements to analysis dialog
- Improvements to task speed instantaneous (new, more robust algorithm)

- Last thermal stats only used if thermal gain > 0 and
  thermal time > 45 seconds.  This prevents spurious entries for ignored
  thermals, or for quick pullups in thermals without sustained turns.

Changes from 5.1.6:
- Map scale display for non-metric units
- Fixed initialisation of AAT properties when adding waypoints from

  on change, to prevent calculations slowing down the refresh.

Changes from 5.1.5 beta 4:
- Infoboxes (AA Time, Task Time To Go, Next Time To Go,
             Task Arrival Time, AA Delta Time)

   if task is edited and not saved.
- Bug fixes to tasman instruments vario
- Text entry dialog uses larger font
- Flight logger can use short file name, if "Logger short file" is true.
- Flight logger gets ID from 3-letter logger ID
  in System config, if not set this defaults to 'AAA'.

  target task is displayed in thick green dashed
- Added new infobox "Thermal All / TC All" for gps vario averaged across
  all time spent in circling mode.

- Calculate AAT time to go if turning now while in sector, then
   going to remaining targets after this.
- AA dT infobox goes blue if task time > AAT time + 5 minutes when in sector

  it is reasonably safe to turn now, even if the target is deeper in the
  sector.  (only if color infoboxes are on)
- Set waypoint bearing and best cruise track to first leg bearing
  when in start sector, so blue arrow points to first target, and

  dialog (e.g. details, move up/down, select, remove) since they're not
  required here.
