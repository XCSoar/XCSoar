Lua Scripting
#############

Starting with version 7.0, XCSoar can be extended using `Lua
<http://www.lua.org/>`__ scripts.

Lua is a language that is easy to learn, powerful enough for XCSoar
and light: the interpreter library weighs just 200 kB. Lua is a common
language choice for integrated scripting languages.


Learning Lua
============

.. code-block:: lua

 print("Hello World")

This manual will not attempt to teach you basic Lua. There are enough
resources on the internet, for example:

-  `Lua 5.4 Reference Manual <http://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/>`__

-  `Programming in Lua <http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html>`__, a book
   on Lua

-  `Tutorial Directory <http://lua-users.org/wiki/TutorialDirectory>`__
   on the lua-users wiki

-  `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_%28programming_language%29>`__

Just to get you started from here, here’s some more example code:

.. code-block:: lua

 -- comment starts with a double hyphen
 
 --[[
 multi
 line
 comment
 ]]--
 
 i = 42
 if i > 1 then
    print("i=" .. i)
 elseif i == 0 then
    print("zero")
 else
    error("negative")
 end
 
 a = {1, 'a', 3.14}
 print(a[2])
 
 function f(a, b)
    return a * b
 end
 print(f(2, 3))


Running Lua
===========

The directory :file:`XCSoarData/lua/` may contain Lua scripts (:file:`*.lua`).
The directory :file:`XCSoarData/lua/lib/` may contain Lua libraries to be
loaded with ``require``.

After startup, XCSoar starts the script :file:`init.lua` (if it
exists).

The *InputEvent* ``RunLuaFile`` can be used to start additional
scripts. If no parameter is given, the user is asked to choose a file.
Note that the *InputEvent* subsystem is deprecated and will be removed
once Lua support is complete.

As long as a Lua script runs, the XCSoar user interface is blocked. Be careful
not to write scripts that loop forever.

Once the Lua script finishes, the Lua interpreter is shut down –
unless the script has registered a callback (e.g. a ``timer``).  In
that case, the Lua script stays resident until it unregisters all
callbacks (or until XCSoar quits or the user stops the script
explicitly).

Running Lua on the Command Line
-------------------------------

You can experiment with XCSoar Lua scripts with the :program:`RunLua`
command-line tool, e.g.::

  make output/UNIX/bin/RunLua
  ./output/UNIX/bin/RunLua test/lua/geo.lua

Most libraries are missing here (everything specific to a full
XCSoar), but some very basic things can be tested here, for example
the HTTP client and the geo library (class ``GeoPoint``).  Being a
small non-interactive command-line program, it is also easy to debug
with :program:`gdb` and :program:`valgrind`.


Lua Standard Libraries
======================

XCSoar enables the following Lua standard libraries:

-  ``package``

-  ``table``

-  ``string``

-  ``math``

Lua’s ``print()`` function writes to the XCSoar log file
(:file:`XCSoarData/xcsoar.log`).

The ``error()`` function aborts the Lua script and reports the specified
error message to the user.

XCSoar adds another function to the root namespace: ``alert()``.  It
shows a dialog with the specified message, and returns as soon as the
user has closed the dialog.  This function is experimental, and may
disappear or be renamed at any time.  Most importantly: do not abuse
it, as it may annoy the user.

XCSoar's Lua API

The package/namespace ``xcsoar`` provides access to XCSoar. It
