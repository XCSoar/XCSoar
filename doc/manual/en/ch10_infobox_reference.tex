\chapter{InfoBox Reference}\label{cha:infobox}
InfoBox data types are grouped into logical categories.

All InfoBoxes display their data in user-specified units.  Whenever the content 
is invalid, the displayed value will be '---' and the content is
greyed out.  This happens, for example, when no terrain elevation is found for 
the `Terrain Elevation' InfoBox, or in the same way for a derived InfoBox like 
`Height AGL'.

Some of the InfoBox contents are modifiable complex values like `MC setting', or `Wind'. Most of 
those values are now accessible through an InfoBox dialogue. It is a short cut to quickly 
change the most often accessed items. An InfoBox dialogue is opened by long press to the InfoBox 
(Touchscreen devices), or `Select' and `Enter' (PC).

In the following description of the InfoBox types, the first
title is as it appears in the InfoBox configuration dialogue box, the
second title is the label used in the InfoBox title.

\section{Altitude}

\ibig{Altitude GPS}{Alt GPS}{This is the altitude above mean sea level reported by the
GPS. (Touch-screen/PC only) In simulation mode this value is adjustable with the
up/down arrow keys. The right/left arrow keys also cause the glider to turn.\footnotemark[1]}

is not available.}

obtained from the terrain file. The value is coloured red when the glider is
below the terrain safety clearance height.\footnotemark[1]}  
\ibi{Terrain elevation}{Terr Elev}{This is the elevation of the terrain above mean
sea level obtained from the terrain file at the current GPS location.}

\section{Aircraft state}

active in simulation mode, pressing the up and down arrows adjusts the speed, 
left and right turns the glider.}

this InfoBox is active in simulation mode, pressing the up and down arrows
adjusts the track.}

bearing, to the bearing of the next waypoint, or for AAT tasks, to the bearing
to the target within the AAT sector. GPS navigation is based on the track
bearing across the ground, and this track bearing may differ from the glider's
heading when there is wind present. Chevrons point to the direction the glider
needs to alter course to correct the bearing difference, that is, so that the
glider's course made good is pointing directly at the next waypoint.  This
bearing takes into account the curvature of the Earth.}

intelligent vario.}

\section{Glide ratio}

\ibi{GR instantaneous}{GR Inst}{Instantaneous glide ratio over ground, given

speed divided by the vertical speed (GPS speed) over the last 20 seconds. 
Negative values indicate climbing cruise. If the vertical speed is close to
zero, the displayed value is '---'.}

divided by the altitude lost since the top of the last thermal. Negative values
indicate climbing cruise (height gain since leaving the last thermal). If the

value is '---'.}
\ibi{L/D vario}{L/D Vario}{Instantaneous lift/drag ratio, given by the indicated
airspeed divided by the total energy vertical speed, when connected to an
intelligent variometer.  Negative values indicate climbing cruise. If the total
energy vario speed is close to zero, the displayed value is '---'.}
\ibi{GR average}{GR Avg}{The distance made in the configured period of time ,
divided by the altitude lost since then. Negative values are shown as 
\^{ }\^{ }\^{ } and indicate climbing cruise (height gain). Over 200 of GR the
value is shown as +++ . You can configure the period of averaging.
Suggested values are 60, 90 or 120. Lower values will be closed to 
GR inst., and higher values will be closed to GR cruise. Notice that the distance 
is \textit{not} the straight line between your old and current position, it's exactly the 
distance you have made even in a zigzag glide. This value is not calculated while 
circling.}
