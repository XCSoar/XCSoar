\end{itemize}

\section{Threads and Locking}

\subsection{Threads}

XCSoar runs on multiple threads, to make the UI responsive but still
allow expensive background calculations.

This is how it looks like on Windows and Linux/SDL (software
rendering):

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node(ui)[thread]{UI thread};

  \path(ui.east)+(4,0) node(draw)[thread]{DrawThread};
  \draw[->] (ui.10) -- (draw.170)
  node[midway, above, sloped, font=\tiny]{redraw (Pan)};
  \draw[->] (draw.190) -- (ui.350)
  node[midway, below, sloped, font=\tiny]{BufferCanvas};

  \path(draw.south)+(0,-2) node(calc)[thread]{CalcThread};
  \draw[->] (calc.north) -- (draw.south)
  node[midway, below, sloped, font=\tiny]{results};

  \path(calc.south)+(0,-2) node(merge)[thread]{MergeThread};
  \draw[->] (merge.north) -- (calc.south)
  node[midway, below, sloped, font=\tiny]{results};

  \path(merge.south)+(-3,-2) node(device1)[thread]{Device};
  \draw[->] (device1.north) -- (merge.250)
  node[midway, above, sloped, font=\tiny]{sensor data};

  \path(merge.south)+(3,-2) node(device2)[thread]{Device 2};
  \draw[->] (device2.north) -- (merge.290)
  node[midway, above, sloped, font=\tiny]{sensor data};

  \path(ui.south)+(0,-3) node(io)[thread]{I/O thread};
  \draw[->] (io.north) -- (ui.south)
  node[midway, above, sloped, font=\tiny]{data};
  \draw[->] (io.east) -- (merge.west)
  node[midway, above, sloped, font=\tiny]{sensor data};
\end{tikzpicture}

The UI thread is the main thread.  It starts the other threads and is
responsible for the UI event loop.  No other thread is allowed to
manipulate windows.  The UI thread has a timer which does regular
house keeping twice per second (\texttt{Pro\-cess\-Ti\-mer.cpp}).

The calculation thread (\texttt{Calcu\-la\-tion\-Thread.cpp},
\texttt{Glide\-Com\-pu\-ter*.cpp}) does all the expensive calculations
in background.  It gets data from the devices (through
\texttt{Merge\-Thread}) and forwards it together with calculation
results to the drawing thread and the main thread.

Each device has its own thread (\texttt{Serial\-Port.cpp}).  This is
needed because Windows CE does not support asynchronous COMM port I/O.
The thread is stopped during task declaration (which happens in the UI
thread).

When new data arrives on the serial port, the \texttt{Merge\-Thread}
gets notified, which will merge all sensor values into one data
structure.  It will then run cheap calculations, and forwards
everything to the \texttt{Calcu\-la\-tion\-Thread}.

With OpenGL, the map is rendered live without a buffer.  There is no
DrawThread.

On Android, the UI thread is not the main thread - the main thread is
implemented in Java, managed by Android itself.  The UI thread listens
for events which the Java part drops into the event queue
(\texttt{NativeView.java} and others).  The internal GPS does not need
a thread, it is implemented with Java callbacks.  For Bluetooth I/O,
there are two threads implemented in Java (\texttt{InputThread.java}
and \texttt{OutputThread.java}, managed by
\texttt{BluetoothHelper.java}).

\subsection{Locking}

Some data structures are rarely modified.  There is no lock for them.
For a modifications, all threads must be suspended.  Example:
waypoints, airspaces.

Other data structures are modified so often that correct locking would
be too much overhead.  Each thread and each instance has its own
copy.  The lock needs to be obtained only for making the private
copy.  The private copy can be used without locking.  Example:
\texttt{NMEA\_INFO}, \texttt{DERIVED\_INFO}.

There are objects which are too expensive to copy.  Normal locking
applies to them.  We have a template class called \texttt{Guard} to
enforce proper read/write locking.  Example: the task.


\section{Accessing Sensor Data}

Much of XCSoar deals with obtaining sensor data and visualising it.

Suppose you want to write a dialog that needs the current GPS
location, where do you get it?  The short and simple answer is: from
\verb|CommonInterface::Basic()| (the \texttt{InterfaceBlackboard}).
Example:

\begin{verbatim}
#include "Interface.hpp"

...
  const auto &basic = CommonInterface::Basic();
  if (basic.location_available)
    current_location = basic.location;
\end{verbatim}

This is true for the main thread (aka the ``user interface thread'').
Other threads must not use the \texttt{Interface.hpp} library, because
the \verb|InterfaceBlackboard| is not protected in any way.  It
contains copies of various data structures just for the main thread.

This is how sensor data moves inside XCSoar:

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node(merge)[thread,align=center]{
    MergeThread\\
    BasicComputer\\
    DeviceBlackboard
  };

  \path(merge.north)+(-2,2) node(device1)[thread]{Device 1};
  \draw[->] (device1.south) -- (merge.north)
  node[midway, below, sloped, font=\tiny]{NMEAInfo};

  \path(merge.north)+(2,2) node(device2)[thread]{Device 2};
  \draw[->] (device2.south) -- (merge.north)
  node[midway, below, sloped, font=\tiny]{NMEAInfo};

  \path(merge.south)+(0,-2) node(calc)[thread,align=center]{
    CalcThread\\
    GlideComputer\\
    GlideComputerBlackboard
  };
  \draw[->] (merge.south) -- (calc.north)
  node[midway, below, sloped, font=\tiny]{MoreData};

  \path(calc.south)+(0,-2) node(ui)[thread,align=center]{
    UI thread\\
    InterfaceBlackboard\\
    BlackboardListener
  };
  \draw[->] (calc.south) -- (ui.north)
  node[midway, below, sloped, font=\tiny]{DerivedInfo};

  \path(ui.east)+(3.5,0) node(draw)[thread,align=center]{
    DrawThread\\
    MapWindow\\
    MapWindowBlackboard
  };
  \draw[->] (ui.east) -- (draw.west)
  node[midway, below, sloped, font=\tiny]{DerivedInfo};
\end{tikzpicture}

The device driver parses input received from its device into its own
\texttt{NMEAInfo} instance inside \texttt{DeviceBlackboard}
(i.e. \verb|per_device_data|).  Then it wakes up the
\texttt{MergeThread} to merge the new data into the central
\texttt{NMEAInfo} instance.  The \texttt{MergeThread} hosts the
\texttt{BasicComputer} which attempts to calculate missing data (for
example, derives vario from GPS altitude).

The \texttt{CalculationThread} wakes up and receives the
\texttt{MoreData} object from \texttt{DeviceBlackboard}.  Here,
expensive calculations are performed (\texttt{GlideComputer}: task
engine, airspace warnings, ...), resulting in a \texttt{DerivedInfo}
object.  The \texttt{CalculationThread} runs no more than twice per
second.

Finally, the UI thread wakes up and receives \texttt{MoreData} and
\texttt{DerivedInfo} via \texttt{DeviceBlackboard}.  This updates
InfoBoxes and other UI elements.  On Windows, the map is drawn in a
separate thread, so there's another layer.

Let's get back to the question: where do I get sensor data?  That
depends on who you are:

\begin{itemize}

\item you are the user interface: (InfoBoxes, dialogs, any Window
  callback): \texttt{InterfaceBlackboard} (see above).  To get
  notified on changes, register a \texttt{BlackboardListener} (and
  don't forget to unregister it).

\item you are the MapWindow: depends!  If you're being called from
  \texttt{OnPaintBuffer} (i.e.\ inside the \texttt{DrawThread}), you
  must use the \texttt{MapWindowBlackboard}, all others must use the
  \texttt{InterfaceBlackboard}.

\item you are a ``computer'' library: you will get the values as a
  parameter.  Don't try to use the \texttt{GlideComputerBlackboard}
  directly.

\item you are a device driver: implement the method
  \texttt{OnSensorUpdate} or \texttt{OnCalculatedUpdate} if you need
  to know values from other devices or calculation results.

\item everybody else may use the \texttt{DeviceBlackboard}, but be
  sure to lock it while using its data.

\end{itemize}

\section{Debugging XCSoar}

The XCSoar source repository contains a module for the GNU debugger
(\texttt{gdb}).  It contains pretty-printers for various XCSoar types,
including \texttt{Angle}, \texttt{GeoPoint} and others.  These are
helpful when you print values in the debugger.  To use it, start the
debugging session and load the module:

\begin{verbatim}
$ gdb -ex "source tools/gdb.py" output/UNIX/bin/xcsoar
(gdb) run
\end{verbatim}

The module will automatically convert fixed-point to floating point,
radian angles to degrees and more.  You can now do fancy stuff like:

\begin{verbatim}
(gdb) p basic.location
$1 = GeoPoint(7.93911242887 51.1470221074)
(gdb) p basic.date_time_utc
$2 = DateTime(2012/12/23 21:41:57)
(gdb) p basic.track
$3 = 55.2254197961
(gdb) p basic.external_wind
$4 = GeoVector::ZERO
(gdb) p current_leg.vector_remaining
$5 = GeoVector(267.899420345 107957.109724)
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{User interface guidelines}

\section{General}

\begin{itemize}
\item Minimise the number of colours, and re-use colour groups already defined.
\item Too much use of colour where it is not required serves only to reduce 
 the effectiveness of bright colours for important items.
\item High colour saturation elements should be reserved for high importance items
\item High contrast against background should be reserved for high importance items
\item Attempt to adopt colours that are intuitive based the function of the item
\item Minimise the clutter where possible --- readibility is essential for use 
 in flight
\item Use colours defined in \verb|Graphics| according to functional name, not 
 their actual colour.
\item Try to maintain consistent use of colours in all uses of that function, 
 such as dialogue graphics as well as map overlays and infoboxes.
\item Text should always be monochrome.
\end{itemize}

Use aviation conventions or adopt best aviation human factors
standards where possible, in particular:
\begin{itemize}
\item ICAO Internation Standards and Recommended Practices, Annex 4 to the 
 Convention on International Civil Aviation (Aeronautical Charts).
\item NASA Colour Usage recommendations and design guidelines: \verb|http://colorusage.arc.nasa.gov/|
\item DOT/FAA/AR-03/67 {\em Human Factors Considerations in the Design and 
 Evaluation of Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs)} \verb|http://www.volpe.dot.gov/hf/aviation/efb/docs/efb_version2.pdf|
\item FAA Human Factors Design Standards \verb|http://hf.tc.faa.gov/hfds/|.
\item DOT/FAA/AM-01/17 {\em Human Factors Design Guidelines for Multifunction Displays}
\end{itemize}

Check for performance with respect to colour blindness.
This site has a useful tool that can be used to convert screenshots
to how they would look to a person with common color blindness:
\verb|http://www.etre.com/tools/colourcheck/|.

{\bf For safety purposes, avoid use of elements that may encourage or require 
the user to stare at the screen continuously.}

{\bf For safety purposes, avoid user controls that have significant risk of 
producing unsafe results if misconfigured by the pilot.}

\subsection{General colour conventions}
Colour conventions generally in use throughout the program:
\begin{itemize}
\item Red for indicator of warning
\item Orange for indicator of caution
\item Green for positive indicator of safety
\item Blue for neutral indicator of safety
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Displayed data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Where data is invalid, indicate this by not presenting the data or
  showing dashes.
\item Present data in user-defined units.
\item Display numerical data with significant digits appropriate to the accuracy of the
  calculations, or its functional use by the pilot, whichever is lower.
\end{itemize}

\section{Dialogs and menu buttons}

\subsection{Colors}
Colour conventions in use are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Grey for buttons
\item Buttons and other widgets rendered with an evenly shaded border
\item Yellow for clicked items
\item Light blue for the key focused item
\item Medium blue for dialogue title bar
\item Text is black if the item is enabled
\item Text is greyed out (but still visible) if the item is disabled
\end{itemize}

\subsection{dialogue types and navigation buttons}
There are four types of dialogs in XCSoar, and the navigation 
buttons for each are different.  
Navigation buttons are the Close, OK, Cancel and Select buttons.
\begin{itemize}
\item Dialogs that modify and save data when the dialogue closes.

These shall usually have a Close button (no Cancel) and may have context specific 
function buttons
\item Dialogs that modify data where Cancel would be important for the user.

These shall have OK and Cancel buttons.  This may include dialogs with 
children dialogs where hitting Cancel from the parent dialogue cancels 
all the changes made in the children dialogs

\item Dialogs that have a list of values, one of which can be selected to 
 return to the parent dialogue.

These shall have Select and Cancel buttons
\item Dialogs that display information that cannot be modified.

These shall have a Close button
\end{itemize}

\subsection{dialogue button placement and size}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Close and Cancel buttons will never appear in the same dialogue and 
 are always located in the same place.  This location will be:

For portrait: lower right

For landscape: lower left
\item The Select button will be accompanied with a Cancel button.  The locations will be:

For portrait: Select in lower left, Cancel in lower right

For landscape: Cancel in lower left, Select immediately above it
\item Buttons will be 35 (scaled) pixels high
\item Buttons will be flush with the bottom of the screen and with the sides of 
 the screen and against each other (no margins)
\item In portrait, buttons will be 33% or 50% or 100% width of the screen
\item In landscape, buttons will be 65 to 80 (scaled) pixels wide, as wide as the 
 frame permits.  They will generally be a vertical row of buttons flush left of the screen
\item If text won't fit on a button, the buttons can be made larger consistently 
 for a screen, but this should be the exception because if it must contain that 
 much text consider using a different type of control.
\item Exceptions to all the dialogue concepts above are encouraged, but should be 
 mocked up and reviewed with the development community prior to implementing and 
 possibly documenting in the developers guide.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability}
\begin{itemize}
\item Minimum size of buttons should be X by Y mm
\item Ensure all dialogs are navigable using cursor keys only
\item Ensure the focussed item is clearly identified.  The rectangle
  of the widget on the canvas may be drawn using the \verb|fill_focus| method
  of \verb|Canvas|.
\end{itemize}

\section{Main graphics}

\subsection{Colors}
Colour conventions in use, in order of priority, are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Aircraft black and white, for neutrality but clear identification
\item Traffic (FLARM) use alarm green, orange, and red.
\item Lift is vibrant green, sink is copper orange.
\item Aircraft navigation (route, best cruise track) is (ICAO) dark purple-blue
\item Task navigation lines and areas are (ICAO) magenta.
\item Updraft sources and other updraft derived data is sky blue.
\end{itemize}

(Todo) airspace alert colours

Map culture (topography) and terrain rendering should conform to ICAO
Annex 4 where appropriate.  Note that some modifications are
reasonable for electronic use given that Annex 4 deals with paper
charts.  Nevertheless, the colour conventions are useful to adopt as they are
likely to be intuitive and are designed for aviation use.

\subsection{Pen styles}

\begin{itemize}
\item Map culture should be rendered with a thin pen
\item Thicker pens used for important (e.g.\ task, navigational, airspace) lines
\item Dashed lines are used to increase perceptual priority
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Map overlays}
Elements on the map that are not part of the map layer, such as additional
informational widgets (final glide bar, wind, north arrow) should be rendered
so as to help those elements be visually separated from the map:

\begin{itemize}
\item Generally adopt higher contrast (higher colour saturation or darker shade) 
 than the background map layer elements.

\item For elements covering an area (non line), draw the entire element or a border
with a luminosity contrasting pen, of width \verb|IBLSCALE(1)|.

\item Consider whether the widget is required in all flying states and display modes.
if it does not serve a direct functional purpose in some states/modes, do not
render it.

\item Avoid locating widgets at the aircraft symbol (ownship symbol).
It is important to keep this area clear so the aircraft symbol can be easily found.

\end{itemize}

Elements that may be rendered over each other should be organised in order of
priority, particularly with alert warning items above caution items above non-alert items.

\section{Terminology}
\subsection{Glide Ratio}
'Glide ratio' is a non-specific term which can refer to the ratio of horizontal to 
vertical motion with reference to either the surrounding airmass or the ground.

To reduce confusion, ground-referenced glide ratios (eg distance travelled over 
ground vs altitude lost) should be referred to by the term 'glide ratio over 
ground' when space allows, or 'glide ratio' / 'GR'.

Air-referenced glide ratios (eg airspeed vs sink rate) should be specified as 
'lift/drag ratio' / 'L/D ratio' / 'LD'. The lift/drag ratio is numerically equal 
to the air-referenced glide ratio when flying at constant speed.

If usage spans both air-referenced and ground-referenced glide ratios, the 
non-specific term 'glide ratio' / 'GR' should be used. 'Lift/drag ratio' should 
never be used to refer to ground-referenced glide ratios.
